# World News website

This is a project website that is modeled after news websites. 

## How to run

Since this webapp involves javascript, it should be run with a live server

## How to navigae website

Since this project does not include a backend, I have created 8 simulated news articles. You can filter the articles by newest or oldest in the navigation sidebar. I have not included functionality for sorting by author since there is not a backend to provide enough data to fill the screen. Only the homepage of the website is made, although the other pages would probably look similar. When you click on an article, it shows the article in full screen at the same URL. Since I'm unsure how to connect to the browser back button, you have to use the back button on the webpage to return home.
